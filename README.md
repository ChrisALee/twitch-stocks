# Twitch Stocks
Twitch Stocks allows you to invest in Twitch streamers using virtual points. (No money involved)
Say your favorite streamer averages 20,000 viewers one week and you invest in them.
The next week they managed to bump their average viewer count to 22,000. You just profited!
Maybe you're feeling risky and want to invest in a low-viewer streamer in the hopes that they blow up in viewership.
### Everything, such as using viewer count as value, is tentative at this point.
