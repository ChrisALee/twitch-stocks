# Contributing Guidelines
Thank you for checking out Twitch Stocks!

We're very much in the early planning phase and are still looking for people of all experience levels to work with.

As such, these guidelines may change drastically.

## Submitting changes

Follow these steps to contribute:

* Fork the repo
* Create a new branch (git checkout -b improve-feature)
* Make the appropriate changes in the files
* Add changes to reflect the changes made
* Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Improve feature')
* Push to the branch (git push origin improve-feature)
* Create a Pull Request

## Coding conventions
* Indent using x spaces (soft tabs)
